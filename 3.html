    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="html-word">HTML</span>)</strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web browsers receive <span class="html-word">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="html-word">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="html-word">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> elements are delineated by <em>tags</em>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="tag-example">&lt;img /&gt;</span> and <span class="tag-example">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce content into the page. 
        Other tags such as <span class="tag-example">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the <span class="html-word">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <em>tags</em> (and their <em>attributes</em>), 
        <em>character-based data types, character references</em> and <em>entity references</em>. 
        <span class="html-word">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="tag-example">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="tag-example">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent 
        <em>empty elements</em> and so are <em>unpaired</em>, for example <span class="tag-example">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the 
        <em>start tag</em>, and the second is the <em>end tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important component is the <span class="html-word">HTML</span> <em>document type declaration</em>, which triggers standards mode rendering.
    </p>
    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
